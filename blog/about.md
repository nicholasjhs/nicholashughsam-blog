In 2018, I graduated from a top university in a top program with some top grades.

It's only normal that I thought what was going to come next was: the top of my life.

A fulfilling career, great relationships, lots of money, happiness all around and feeling at the top of the world.

Except, that's not what happened at all.

You see, I actually got a bachelor's in Software Engineer.

Did I love software engineer? Nope.

Did I love coding? Nope.

In fact, the only thing I knew about software engineer before applying was that it had something to do with computers...

but did that stop me from applying? Nope.

The word around town was that employment was almost a guarantee and everyone in the field was making big bucks. And that was enough for me it seems.

Fast forward almost 7 years where I tried 3 different roles (Software Engineer, Business Technology Analyst and Solutions Engineer) across 4 different companies and I was still feeling totally unfufilled and uninspired in my career.

Not only that, but during the past 7 years, I also consumed dozens of self-help & business books, hundreds of hours listening to various podcasts and thousands of hours watching YouTube videos from anyone and everyone.

And what did that amount to? Nothing, except a lot of overthinking, some mild episodes of depression and some more doing nothing.

Well, all that changed when, in the summer of 2024, I decided to take a leap of faith and sign up for some coaching sessions with one of the best podcasters in the world (at the time).

Even though I was very skeptical at first, it actually transformed my life because those coaching sessions forced me to do one thing: take authentic action.

The coaching forced me to look real hard at myself and at all the programming I've received since I was young and filter out everything that was noise vs everything that was me.

Thus, I was able to take action that was aligned with who I truly am. And it was liberating.

I've now come to realize that I want to spend my time studying, helping and teaching about how to live happier, freer and more authentic lives.

And although I am still (and always will be) a work in progress, I am eager to share what I learned.

Here are a few sentences that I connect with:
- The truth shall set you free.
- All is well right now.
- It is simple, we just overcomplicate it.
- You are your own hero.
- Life is about progress, not perfection.
- Don't think. Take action and iterate.
