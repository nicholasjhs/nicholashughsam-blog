I am not feeling good.

I've been exhausted since Thursday and the hard training on Saturday did not help me.

I'm not sure if it's because I'm sick, but I am also feeling the stress of 75HARD even more so than at the beginning of the challenge.

I will still complete it for sure; however, I am very very looking forward to the end of it.

I do think being tired is affecting me. I usually would not mind sleeping later to spend time with JB, but now that I'm feeling sickly and have a tournament this weekend, I want to sleep and recover.

It's been a hard couple of days, I'll update when I feel better.
