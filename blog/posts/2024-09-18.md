**Day:** 

- Woke up early and am finding out that a lot of meetings are getting cancelled.
- Did my first SAE interview with our CEO.
- Modified the script that allows to create demos (making my work easier).
- Went for a walk while doing groceries.
- Cooked the mediterranean shrimp recipe again for lunch.
- Signed up at CEPSUM (hope I won't regret the membership).
- Ran around the track as a workout.
- Finished the Diary of a CEO podcast with Mo Gawdat (really good and different way of thinking - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxVNR0Om-lA)
- Found time to make my way to JB's house to sleep over.

Today will be very short as I try to spend more time with JB.

I am in a mode where I'm constantly doing things, I have no time to think and I do not like it.

My old problem was that I was thinking too much; now, not enough.

I am consuming great pieces of knowledge (podcast and currently reading Chop Wood, Carry Water), but find myself having no time to digest and internalize the lessons being shared.

Potential solution: Find a dedicated time to think about these things, maybe not a daily basis, but weekly is good. Take notes and ponder on them at the end of the week.
