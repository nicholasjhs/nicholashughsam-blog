I've been slacking a bit on my workshop.

I'll write more about it during my weekly recap, but this week has been pretty good overall and the consequence of that is I spent less time thinking.

I've been doing a lot and just "living in the moment".

I think part of the reason why I'm thinking less is that I lack sleep.

But because I've been doing physical exercise every single day (since sunday), it's keeping me energized and sharp.

So if you mix "too tired to think" with "exercise is keeping my spirits up", I get into a mode where I have enough energy to do tasks and take action, but not enough to think needlessly.

This simply confirms that working out every single day is a habit I want to keep to be my best self.

Tomorrow and Sunday I have more free time so I'll work on my workshop then.

I am glad I moved it from the 7th to the 21st as it gives me more time to create it and market it.

My goal for this weekend is to finish the eventbrite and be ready to launch it next week.

I want to remind myself that this event should not be a source of anxiety for me.

It's an event where I get to share what I love the most to people and help them live better, happier and more authentic lives.

Not sure if I'll be doing workshops forever, but I know my work will be related to this so why not get used to it now.
