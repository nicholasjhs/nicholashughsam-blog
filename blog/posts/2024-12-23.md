**Day:** 

- Woke up early without an alarm, I've been sleeping very weirdly lately.
- Lost some time on my phone this morning.
- Went to the gym.
- Rushed to go home and eat quickly before meeting with AT.
- Met up with AT at a pretty nice coffee shop (it was a good talk, time flew by).
- Went to go play badminton with YBD (last practice in a while?).
- Went to go eat at Kinton with YBD (I am not taking the spicy soup again, that sh*t was making me cough HARD).
- Dropped YBD home.
- Potato mode when I got back.
- Hopefully won't sleep super super late.

I'm hella confused about what to do during my holiday break.

One part of me wants to maybe relax because I've been working hard and now it's time for a good break of just being.

Another part of me wants to take this as an opportunity to work on my own things.

I think the answer is probably both.

I should take a few days off where I really don't do anything or do some very minor work to recharge my energy.

And then, decide on a date to start working on my own things again.

That is what I will do.

I do think I deserve a break because I haven't had one in a hot minute.

I'm also hella confused in general about a lot of things.

It's a good time to take a step back and be with myself more.
