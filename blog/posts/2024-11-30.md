**Day:** 

- Ate a big breakfast.
- MBPC Practice.
- Ate quickly coming back home.
- Met up quickly with JB to get my fellowship tshirt and give back her socks.
- Attended Montreal Worship for the first time (it was good, I didn't like the xmas songs though).
- Went to Johnny's birthday party (I had not gone out in such a long time, it was really nice).

I find myself wanting to go out more recently.

I think it's lonely and sad to just stay at home so I'm trying to get out as much as possible and keep myself busy.

When JB and I were a couple, I'd love having my little calm nights to myself as it was just a way to recharge.

Now, my default is those nights alone.

It feels weird, but I guess I'll get used to it eventually.

It felt really nice going at Johnny's birthday, being surrounded by people and making casual conversations.

The drinking scene is really not my vibe, but maybe I'll find something that's in-between.

Going out, being surrounded by people, being able to have nice conversations and not having everyone inebriated.
