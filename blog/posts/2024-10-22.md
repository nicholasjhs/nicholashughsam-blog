I am starting to get slightly overwhelmed with work and this 75hard challenge.

It's great that I'm completing the challenge every day, but all my days look the same.

The only variation I have is during the weekend where I feel like I'm living.

And then during the week, I just brain fog out, go through the motions and look forward to my 1-2 hours where I'm eating and watching something.

I might be getting close to a "burn out".

Not an intense one so it's probably not called a burnout.

Whatever it is, I can feel it coming...

I think I am under-rested and need 1 day to just chill and recover.

Maybe I should try sleeping a bit more.

I used to sleep 7.5-8 hours and now it's more like 7 hours.

That extra 0.5-1 hour might be the difference maker !
