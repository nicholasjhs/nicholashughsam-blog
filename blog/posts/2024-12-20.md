- Picked up my friends to go bouldering.
- Ran at the gym before bouldering.
- Bouldered with friends.
- Ate Lan Zhou Noodles with my friend DL.
- Had an impromptu catch up call with JB (it's so nice seeing both of us in happier states).

Today I learned that the environment I'm in affects the way I show up in the world.

Especially when I'm with DL, he was a big part of my old life so whenever I'm with him, I have a harder time being my current self and revert back a bit into my old habits, patterns & fears.

Just an observation that I need to be more aware of when I hangout with him.

In other news, it's interesting to learn more about this theory of masculine and feminine energy, it's very similar to my own thoughts, but makes them slightly more tangible.

"I need to work on cultivating more masculine energy" is something I could not put into words based on my own theories.

That's all I have to say for today, I'm just looking forward to relaxing properly during the next 2 weeks.
