- Spent the day with JB.
- Went on a walk.
- Ate supper with JB while watching (The Playbook: A coach's rule for life).
- Went to play badminton with JB and Yuan at Etienne of the Hammer.

I've revised the terms used in my dope, dope, dope post.

After discussing with JB, I've come to realize that dope things is not necessarily what I'm looking for.

Whenever I think of dope, it entices too much to think about what might be dope or cool.

Instead,  I found that thinking of **fun** things is much better.

I decided to change my philosophy to: Work with good people on fun things to live an interesting life.
