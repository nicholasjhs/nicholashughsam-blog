This year, Christmas felt different.

The family seemed closer.

We played games as a whole family (thanks AHS and NT) and the gifts almost felt like an afterthought.

This is what I want Christmas to be for me and I'm so glad the whole family is going towards this shared vision.

It might be because of the breakup, but I feel this immense sense of wanting to be closer to my loved ones.

Whether it be friends or family, this whole notion of "success" is starting to slowly fade away from my head.

It's not exactly what I was expecting, but everything is welcomed.

I want to focus on no longer trying to plot, manipulate or attempt to take control of my future especially when it pertains to money, material success or fame.

It was a great time with the family and I'm looking forward to next year.
