**Day:**  

- Not bad at work, honestly. Today, I saw myself staying until my 2 years mark, but I know how quickly things can change.
- Started watching The Departed.
- Proud to have squeezed in a good gym session (realized that there's still something messed up with my left glute, it was apparent when I did single leg RDLs on the landmine).
- Supper with Rob and Nhu.

Man, I came back home at 12 and thought I'd be able to sleep earlier today.

The plan was to get home, take my shower quickly, write my daily entry, brush my teeth, talk to my love and go to sleep.

Instead, I came back home, read 1 chapter of manhwa and then scrolled for 20 minutes.

Scrolling is such a waste of time, I really rarely remember whatever I scrolled.

It's like in the movie "Office Space" where Andy asks to be "zapped".

I just spend time on social media, look at the time and boom, 20-30 minutes have passed.

It really is a huge waste of time.

Luckily, I was still able to finish all I had to do today so I don't feel shitty.

But man, I have to start building the habit of breaking myself off of social media.
