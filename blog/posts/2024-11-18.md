**Day:** 

- Onsite at a montreal customer. Literally the whole day.
- Ate supper with Tricia @Sam Cha.
- Squeezed in a short gym session because I had to.

Wow !

I only did 3 things today.

It's my shortest yet most complete day to date.

As mentioned in the highlights of my day, I worked from 9am to 6pm nonstop.

We did have a short lunch break, maybe 30 minutes.

Besides that though, I just worked.

Time passed so quickly, my brain was absolutely fried from micro-decision fatigue on how to implement things.

I felt absolutely exhausted and it felt great.

I don't want to work like this often, especially not on this type of work.

It's a nice reminder for myself that, when push comes to shove, I can and will work like a horse to get things done.

Two last things about today.

The first one being that it's my first time ever driving in traffic in the morning to go to work.

It was not as bad as I thought (quite similar to the traffic to go to MBPC tbh), but it still made me very grateful that I get to avoid this every day.

The second one is that after JB and I's conversation last night, I am feeling more inspired and motivated to add more excitement into our relationship.

It reminded me about how easy it is to just be comfortable in the relationship and let things stagnate.

Good refresher.
