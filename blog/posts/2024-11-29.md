I'm truly in a transformation right now.

I can feel it manifest and unfold in all areas of my life.

As long as I continue trusting in God and letting Him move me the way he wants, I know I'll be taken care of.

Actually, maybe not the way I want to be taken care of, but He knows his plan for me.

I'm quite curious to read the book "the surrender experiment" and see if that book talks about the same thing I'm currently experiencing.

It is quite liberating.

Even my discussion with Danny was different.

I wasn't afraid of speaking my mind, I was simply telling him the truth that's within me.

I can still feel my human logic aka ego aka my self interfere, but the most important part is that I am aware !

Awareness leads to discovering the truth and the truth liberates you.
