**Day:** 

- Had a light meeting day at work.
- I was able to focus most of my time on getting the necessary approvals for my app and I'm done with the first functional version of it.
- Ate lunch pretty late while watching Shrinking.
- Saw and talked with JB's little sister on my way to my singing lesson.
- Did my singing class and killed it (I sung All of Me - I realize that I'm so bad at taking compliments).
- Met up with AH to go to blocshop chab and joined a few other friends there.
- Did a big session and finished the upper body training that I didn't complete on Monday.
- Went to go eat poutine @ poutineville (very very meh) with AH.
- Had a late-for-the-weekday talk with her.

Life has been good recently.

Everything seems to flow smoothly (except for my overthinking with AT).

I'm no longer pondering about my career choices or what I can do to get ahead or to become rich or side-hustle and all that blabla.

I'm just being present every day.

Being flexible to whatever comes along.

I really like it.

I'm excited to share this news with RH when he gets back on Saturday.

It's late so imma stop here.
