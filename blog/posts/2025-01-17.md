**Day:** 

- I worked on the app deployment, it's something that I've never done so it's nice to learn.
- I went to the gym.
- I went climbing at le crux laval with AH.
- We then went to Thai Express to eat.
- Ended up talking until 3am about life and everything.

While talking with AH, I realized how much I value, honest, open-minded and people without filters.

I feel like when I talk to her, I don't have to be on guard and it's just always a good time.

Fun, relaxing vibes.

Increasing my social activities has definitely added a lot of positive impact in my life.

Have a safe trip AH !
