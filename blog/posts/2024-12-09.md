- Walked back and passed by the grocery store.
- Ate supper and watched the finale of NE S03 (wow, I'm SO happy about the winner, it was a GREAT show).
- Edited and posted my first clip on living in alignment.

After spending a lot of time avoiding it tonight, I finally posted my first video on Living in alignment.

Granted, this is not the final format that I fear.

I want to make a video of me talking straight into the camera and explaining all these different things, but it's a great step forward.

Every little step I take towards creating content on living happier lives is a step closer to who I want to become and what I want to do.

It's scary, but I'm happy that I finally have the courage to take these baby steps.

Next challenge will be posting a reel / tiktok of me talking straight into the camera and answering a question related to happiness and whatnot.
