**Day:** 

- Good day at the office.
- Socializing at work felt good.
- Went on a walk and wondered why I want people to know that I'm smart.
- Little session of deep work to close the work day.
- Badminton training / playing with Yuann.
- Chilled in the car with Yuaaan and just talked.
- Packed for tomorrow.
- Picked up JB and then dropped her back home.

I missed talking with other people.

I love talking and socializing.

I'm going to say it here, but friendships are my undervalued and under-utilized asset.

I always make sure to do everything else such as be healthy, sleep, exercise, be productive, etc.

I always forget the social part and it's one of my biggest levers of happiness.

I need to remember this.
