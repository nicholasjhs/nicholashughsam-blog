**Day:** 

- First day at work was very good. I was able to concentrate for most of the day. Noticed that sleep plays a big role in how productive I am at work.
- Worked on a web app at work.
- Went to go eat downtown with the MBPC gang (thanks for the meal coach).
- Did my running at the gym.
- Met up with AT to chill.

One thing that I lack at the moment is courage.

The courage to face my fears.

I believe I will take a big step forward in becoming my true self once I become more courageous.

I really wanted to ask AT a question, but couldn't bring myself to ask it because I was afraid of the result.

This fuels me though, this is genuinely something I want to work on.
