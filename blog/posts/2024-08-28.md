**Day:**  

- Work was frustrating. I wanted to get more tasks completed, but I was not able to receive any help due to the time difference.
- I tried to optimize my day to fit so many things. Ultimately, I only fit one thing and it was a good outcome.
- Finished the Alex Hormozi Pod and started listening to it again.
- Played badminton at Brebeuf. Doubles went fairly well, my attack is still weak, but definitely noticed improvements in defence + drives + overall reaction speed.
- Reality Quest (one of my favourite manhwas) is back !!!
- I was present during my shower and it allowed me to indulge in it.

I need more clarity in my life.

I feel like after having finished my sessions with Danny, things have slowly started to become the way it was in the past.

I do not want that.

I don't know what I want to do and purpose and all those things.

However, one thing that's been a constant is that I want to master myself.

There are things I need to fix within myself or for myself and I feel like once I've done enough of those, something will come up.

If you want people to pay attention to you, simply do something extraordinary or something that people want to do themselves.

Mastering myself + sharing my knowledge + helping along the journey.

I need to go to sleep now.
