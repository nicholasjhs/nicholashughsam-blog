**Day:** 

- I killed my demo today, I'm really happy that being alphanique is translating to all areas of my life.
- I'm now in my french rap era.
- Started thinking of going to argentina soon on remote work.
- I started watching Singles Inferno Season 4 !!! (so entertaining this season).
- I went to go play badminton today at CCR (it was fun, definitely not as fun as before though - good cardio).
- Took a chance on asking AV to meet for a coffee Saturday, will update.
