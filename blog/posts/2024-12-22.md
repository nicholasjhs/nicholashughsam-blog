**Day:** 

- Woke up late ish.
- Went to the gym.
- Ate quickly.
- Went to the open mic (sang pretty comfortably for the first time ever).
- PEEPS christmas party (got there so late, I felt bad).
- Had an insane discussion about religion and self-help (did not think it would turn into that).
- Dropped HTN home.
- Got back home and vegetated for a few hours.

I'm happy about my progression in the open mics.

I feel a lot more comfortable singing in front of a small crowd and I hope to continue improving.

I did feel very bad for getting at the xmas party so late.

Part of me knew that I should have skipped the open mic, but I really wanted to sing this week...

It doesn't necessarily make me a bad bad friend, but I can see myself being selfish.

It won't happen too often hopefully.
