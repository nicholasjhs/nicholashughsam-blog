Wow, 75 HARD is actually HARD.

My next few days of posts will most likely only be on 75 hard.

I actually wanted to quit today.

The hardest part is not the workouts. It's the diet and the drinking water.

I am not very confident that I'll complete the challenge. I was super stressed today and, thankfully, I got everything done; however, it really took a mental toll on me. Especially the diet.

The lack of healthy options when you're out is insane. Everything is a trap just waiting for you to grab it and be like "gotcha, I'm actually super processed and unhealthy."

It'll be interesting to see what I end up eating tomorrow while on the road to boston.

Glad I finished day 1.

Also, the e2w show, especially the choreo from ap/ervin/rene/song/christbob (I can't remember exactly, but 3 out of these 5s) made me think about dancing again.

It's funny how the older I get, the more I just want to do what I used to do when I was a kid.

Dance, sing, hangout with friends and play sports.
