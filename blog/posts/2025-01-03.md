**Day:** 

- Spent the day with my family before AHS + NT + IHS go back to Boston.
- Ate lunch and supper there.
- Bonded with the very cute baby.
- Caught up to the young lord assassin manhwa.
- Got myself to go to the gym.

Baby bella is growing so so fast.

I know she'll be like twice her size when I see her again.

I hope she remembers me.

It's nice to be close to family again.
