**Day:** 

- Learned that my ex-manager is going to take a long sabbatical, will talk to him tomorrow.
- Finalized the documentation needed to onboard a new sales engineer on the demo.
- Overall, very relax day at work.
- Went for a walk.
- Picked up JB in the afternoon.
- Ate lunch with her.
- Went for another small walk and went to go get a somewhat disappointed Rockaberry slice (brownie or something).
- MBPC Practice (it was fantastic, I felt so good. My legs were strong, my swing was also strong. Great practice).
- Talked a bit to Rob, it was nice to catch up, I miss him man.
- Watched an episode of Lidia Poet with JB while eating supper.

My day was good.

I liked being able to walk mid-afternoon and then a smaller walk afterwards.

Being active is so important to me, I hope I don't lose sight of it once I finish 75HARD or start my next journey.

I started to become scared of not playing as well after taking a week off when I go to NYC.

I caught myself and was able to relax and stay positive though.

Small improvements mentally and physically.

Looking forward to see more glimpses of growth.
