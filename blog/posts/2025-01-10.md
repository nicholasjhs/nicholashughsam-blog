**Day:** 

- Finished off the week with an ok day at work, I did procrastinate a tiny little bit.
- Watched from Shrinking at lunch.
- Went blocshop with the gang and met a few people.
- Finished bloc late.
- Been obsessed with Bad Bunny's "debí tirar mas fotos" for the past week.
- Went to Café Milano and AT joined me for some late night talks (something shifted since yesterday and I like it way better).
