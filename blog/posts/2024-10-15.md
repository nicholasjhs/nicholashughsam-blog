"There is no such is as over-worked, just under-rested."

I like this phrase. It highlights the importance of resting.

I am definitely still feeling the aftermaths of this weekend's tournament and the late night binge-watching JB and I did on Sunday.

When I'm tired, I feel more lazy, I don't feel like working, I literally just want to be a vegetable.

My thoughts automatically turn to "I hate my job, I want to quit" and I think it's because the schedule doesn't allow me to rest properly (even though it should be on me to rest properly outside of work).

The one positive thought I had during my walk today was about living a very minimal life.

I believe a minimal life with less materialistic things is part of my inner peace.

I believe everyone's goal is to find inner peace for themselves.

I also thought that if I were to quit my job, the one thing I want to do (confirmed again) is help people with their happiness.

It could be workshops, one-on-one, books, content, etc.

It's the thing I keep coming back to.
