**Day:** 

- Got some okay work done this morning. I was able to complete the task I needed to do.
- Ate lunch quickly.
- Went to the optometrist to get my exam done and buy new glasses.
- It was fun talking with DVLH and I was able to choose my new glasses in under an hour (this is an accomplishment for me).
- MBPC practice (I was so out of it).
- Had a nice little discussion with HY after dropping him off.
- Ate supper while finishing Walter Mitty (it was okay).
- Decided to relax instead of recording a vid today.

As I wrote here, I decided to take a break from making a video.

It's only my 4th day, but I find it very important not too force it too much.

I just finished 75HARD not too long ago and if this is something I want to do long-term, pacing is going to be crucial so that I don't burn out.

I'll eventually decide to go harder at it, but for now, I just want to enjoy the process.

I'm also very very happy that I chose my new pair of glasses in under 1h.

I think it took something like 40 minutes and I was pretty decisive about it.

I'm not 100% sure what they look like anymore to be honest haha.

It's a pair of glasses, not like I'll throw away my current ones or anything like that.

It was a low stake decision and I took it in a good amount of time.

This is progress. I'm happy.
