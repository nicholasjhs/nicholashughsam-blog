Short day.

I have a problem and don't know how to put it into words.

It's as if I lost the ability to communicate clearly with others and myself.

It shows in my writing and no matter how hard I try to think in more clear terms, I always fail.

The same is to be said about thinking about the future or my next steps.

Every time I attempt to have deep meditative session, I feel a certain fog in my mind that prevents me from having clear, concise thoughts.

One moment I start to create the thought and the next, I just blank out.

I'd very much like to solve this in order to think clearer and write better.
