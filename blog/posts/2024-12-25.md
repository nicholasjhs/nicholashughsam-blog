**Day:** 

- Woke up pretty tired.
- Went to my mom's to brunch.
- Spent time with my family and the little one (she's sooo cute now).
- Watched our yearly movie (at home though, we watched Beverly Hill Cops Axel F)
- Took a much needed nap.
- Cooked supper and ate while watching Shrinking (this show is making me tear up also every ep at this point lol).
- Switched things around in my house (switched my bedroom and my office).
- Wrapped up my last gift.

I have nothing to say today, except that as I am growing older, I am now appreciating more and more spending time with loved ones no matter what we're doing.

As long as we're present and connecting.

Life is good.
