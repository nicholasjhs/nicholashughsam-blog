**Day:** 

- Walked in the morning.
- Gave a nice little demo at work (I'm really getting more comfortable / better).
- Worked quite a lot for this big demo tomorrow.
- I skipped MBPC practice and did some power yoga (I really loved power yoga, I felt so good in the moment and afterwards).
- I fell in awe of our product and this new version that I'm going to demo tomorrow.
- Stayed late and worked at night to try and get this right.

I need to sleep now.

I will say that I was a bit uncomfortable skipping practice today since I have a tournament this weekend.

Fortunately, as soon as I did my power yoga, all that uncomfortableness went away and I was so glad I got the opportunity to practice power yoga.

I do not wish to be consumed by work, but it feels somewhat nice to put a bit of extra effort from time to time.
