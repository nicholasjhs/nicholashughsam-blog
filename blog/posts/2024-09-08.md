**Day:**  

- ATG workout in the morning (Need to buy myself some of those industrial slants).
- Visited the baby one las time (she'll be so big when I see her next time !)
- Drove back to Montreal.
- Had CAVA for the first time ! (it was good, a bit salty, I wish we had something similar in MTL).
- Saw JB and gave her all the little souvenirs I brought back for her :)
- Cooked a late supper (shrimp with bell peppers and baby spinach + brown rice).
- Focused on finishing my 75HARD dailies.

I'm finally back home.

It's only been a week, but with how much things changed during my week in Boston, it honestly felt like I was there for at least 2 weeks.

It's crazy how our perception of time changes based on new experiences.

Finally glad to be back.

I'm slightly nervous and excited about trying 75HARD here.

There are many different things like making time to see my girlfriend, my friends, badminton (big one), cooking for myself and being in a less active environment (more prone to lazyness).

We'll see how it goes. For now, I am still motivated to crush this challenge and am really treating it as life or death.
