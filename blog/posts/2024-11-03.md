**Day:** 

- Day 2 of the tournament, played doubles well, lost in 3 sets though (happy I was able to change my mentality so quickly).
- Went back home to shower and eat.
- Picked up JB to go watch Yuan's final.
- Went for a walk.
- Ate at my mom's place.
- Chilled with JB.

The tournament is catching up to me and I'm feeling quite tired right now.

I cannot wait to go to sleep, it'll feel so good.

Tried to think about dope ideas on my walk and had a hard time not thinking about ideas that were for the views or for the money.

I think I'll start keeping a backlog of "dope ideas" maybe 1 dope idea every day or something just to brainstorm.

I watched a video with JB that was basically myself talking to the camera and saying the exact same things I'm thinking of doing now aka quitting my job to try and make it on my own, etc.

This was in 2021...

Crazy how I let 3 years go by without doing anything about it.

"If not now, then when?"
