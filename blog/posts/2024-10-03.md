**Day:** 

- Had one funny ass meeting at work. I love joking around.
- I honestly don't remember much. I was tired.
- Went for my walk.
- Ate a lot of lunch.
- I took a nap.
- MBPC practice. Watching someone hit cleanly before playing helps me loosen up during practice (watching Yosia Michael on YT).
- Had a disappointing Mandy's snack bowl (under 15$, took the cilantro cumin dressing and it doesn't taste like much).
- Met JB at her team's practice.

I have a weird relationship with badminton.

It's really a sport I can see myself play for a long time (at least 5 more years), but at the same time, I know that training and playing is taking up space in my life.

I'd love to explore gymming, yoga or even running, but because my priority right now is badminton, I don't want to make the space for those things.

Every time I play though, I'm reminded why I love this sport and feel like I have so much to learn (and can learn almost infinitely).

It's almost like an art. Except, it involves strategy, technique and physical prowess.

But the craft of badminton is most certainly something that exists.

I know I will eventually quit badminton and I also know it will be very bittersweet.

For now though, I am enjoying my progress and am looking forward to getting better each and every single day.
