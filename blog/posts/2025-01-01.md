Leading up to 2025, I've had several people ask me if I had any goals or things I wanted to accomplish in 2025.

I always gave the same answer "no because it never really worked in the past and if I'm going to do something, I'm going to do it regardless of if I say it at the beginning of the year or not."

This is still true.

However, as I was reflecting on my 2024 year, I realized that I do not remember a lot of 2024.

I think it's because it was very easy for me to just fall into a routine and follow it.

The more repetitive the days and weeks become, the more time seems to pass quickly since everything just gets mushed up into the same experience.

I did not like this feeling.

Consequently, I wanted to at least set a few things in motion for 2025 to ensure that I do not get lost in the sauce.

I now realize that 2:30am is not the best time to think about these things.

I will set aside 2 hours tomorrow to organize my life and sort things out.

I haven't done this in a while so I'm excited.
