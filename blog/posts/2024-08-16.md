- Ate lunch with JB, it's always nice waking up with her !
- Went for a long walk, they're the best.

It's crazy how long I was putting off creating my blog.

And today I finally decided to do it...

It took me 2 hours to complete, I was so sucked into it.

I guess this is a perfect example of the sayings "the hardest part is always starting" or "starting is already 50% of the job done".

My blog isn't perfect yet and that's totally fine.

The point of what I'm trying to achieve more of is taking action and iterating.

My blog is the perfect example of that.

It has the minimal style I'm looking for, but it can use a tiny bit more styling.

I also have to make it available to the internet !

Right now though, it's 2:30am, I feel like a night owl / degenerate so Ima stop here.

Feels nice to put in some work and create something out of nothing.
