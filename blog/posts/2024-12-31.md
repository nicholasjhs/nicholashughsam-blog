**Day:** 

- Woke up early to go gym with my cousin AC (it was fun, brought us closer together).
- Did some groceries for the potluck at night.
- Started watching Squid Game S02.
- Cooked JB's famous soup (the sausages were different though so it did not taste the same).
- Spent NYE at CD + RY's place with some of their other friends.
- Officially went into 2025.
- Stayed up talking until 4:30am.

It's weird because I know that 2024 was a good year, but I can't remember much from it haha.

The end of it was definitely unexpected.

Overall, I think it was great.

Time for a new year.

Welcome to 2025 !
