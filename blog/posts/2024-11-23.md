Yet again, another bittersweet beginning.

I wasn't sure at first if I officially wanted this to be my last tournament or not.

After getting the best result of my A level career, I believe that it's time to call it quits.

The vibe is different, my heart is no longer in it.

One of the reasons I kept on for so long with badminton is because of the social aspect and now that I've lost that, I do not see any reason to continue anymore.

I might still play for fun, get a good cardio workout in, make my legs workout.

Competition though? I am done.

I do think I'll continue training until the holidays where I'll officially stop my competitive career.

It's been a wild ride and when that day comes, I'll definitely write a letter to badminton.

It's very weird to have so many changes in a short period of time.

The moment I'll quit DG, it'll add one more thing to that list of changes.

5 is my favourite number so there's no surprise that 2025 will be a great year for me.

I am extremely hopeful for the future and all the new things that will come into my life.

I'm actually very excited !
