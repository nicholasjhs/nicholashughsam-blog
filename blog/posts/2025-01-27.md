The situation with AV was affecting me more than I thought.

This morning I realized it wasn't because of the romantic part of things, it was the friendship.

The sudden probable loss of someone with whom I got along very well with was shocking to me.

I've never had this happen before.

Even with JB, we're still kinda friends and talk from time to time.

All the other people that I've lost contact with were people that I gradually lost contact with, it wasn't a sudden cut off.

I understand AV's point and it made me reflect on how courageous I am.

Even though it affects her too, she's willing to go through with it because it's the right thing to do and the thing that will cause the least amount of pain in the long run for both of us.

This whole situation made me question how intentional I am with my time and the people I spend time with.

It also made me realize that I lack courage.

I have a feeling courage will be a big word for me this year.

Acting despite being afraid and doing the right thing.

This aligns well with my goal of living in truth.
