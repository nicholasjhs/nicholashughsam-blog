Today was very much a recharge day.

Cooking takes a lot of time especially when I'm trying to prep for at least half the week.

It was good though, I enjoyed cooking and as I cook more, I can see myself seeing less as a burden and more empowering that I can cook good, healthy food for myself.

I think days like these where the whole goal is to reset and get ready for the week to come are needed.

I'm looking forward to my yoga session to wind down.

I want next week to be productive at work as I noticed I still have a few knowledge gaps when it comes to preparing the demos.

Hopefully, with the meal prep I did, I'll spend less time cooking and more time in deep work sessions.

Upcoming busy week, let's GET IT.
