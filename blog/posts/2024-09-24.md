It's past my bedtime and I need to shower + brush my teeth.

I'll keep it short.

Sales Engineering is hard. I did not do well in my first 3 demos.

I think it's normal since I literally have no experience.

I am very much welcoming the challenge though, it's weird to say, but it feels good to be bad at something.

In order to enjoy work, I think it has to be a bit challenging, too easy and I get disengaged.

For now, I am concentrating on getting better at demoing.

In other news, my badminton practice went great.

I played amazing in the doubles game we did after not believing in myself.

Confidence is really the key in many many many things in life.

Never doubt yourself and things will go better.

I also need to remember to twist my torso (my badminton technique is getting better).
