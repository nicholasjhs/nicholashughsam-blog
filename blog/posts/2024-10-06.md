**Day:** 

- Lazy morning.
- Cooked myself some yummy chicken breast with vegetables and short grain brown rice (that sh*t slaps).
- Watched the last episode of Pop Star Academy (this show made me cry so many times man).
- Went on my walk.
- Cleaned the bathroom.
- Ate a wonderful bun cha (all natural ingredients) meal at my mom's place.
- Yoga with JB.
- Get ready for the next day.

I used to feel so bad whenever I had a relaxing day where I did nothing.

Now, I cannot wait for days where I just laze around and relax.

Not on the computer though. Watching TV is fine.

I feel like it doesn't affect me as much as the computer.

Today was a much needed day and I'll also rest tomorrow to get my body ready for this week's tournament.

On another note, my neck has been KILLING me recently.

It feels constantly strained and my neck movements always feel limited.

Working on the computer definitely does not help.

Maybe I'll consult for this.
