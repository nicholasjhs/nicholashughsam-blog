**Day:** 

- MBPC Practice (I love doing the physical circuit, it was hard, but rewarding).
- Started watching Rhythm and Flow France S03 (that sh*t is so good).
- First group singing lesson on pitch (the lesson was not very informative, but I did perform for the first time ever).
- Made myself some asian stir-fry with chicken + zucchini + cherry tomatoes (a bit too soy-sauce, not sweet enough).
- Watching a lot of R+F France (also called "Nouvelle Ecole") until 3am.

Wow what a day.

It had been a long long time since I've indulged in binging a show until 3am.

Towards the end, I did feel bad.

I almost could have finished the whole series, but by that point, it was almost 3:30am so I didn't want to push it.

This indicates to me that I still have some healing to do.

Why do I feel like it's unreasonable to stay up until 4-5am to watch a show if I can wake up at any time I want the next day?

I know that it's bad overall for my health, but if I only do it once, it should be fine.

Anyway, this is a very minor fear / conditioning that probably won't affect too much.

It's still interesting to be aware of it and note it down in my mind.

Nouvelle Ecole S03 is great, I can't wait to watch the finale.
