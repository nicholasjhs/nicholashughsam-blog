There is 0 upside to beating ourselves up mentally.

It never pushes you to take action.

Instead of wasting time doing negative self-talk, it is better to simply take action to change the situation.

If no action is going to be taken no matter what, then the bad self-talk is useless.

Recollect yourself, take the L today and reset tomorrow.

The habit of talking negatively to yourself is worse than you not taking action today.
