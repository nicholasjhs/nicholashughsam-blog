My plan was to take 2 weeks off at the beginning of december to travel to asia and join Mr. PDS there and then take 1 week off during the christmas/new year period.

I asked my manager and it got shut down, saying that 3 weeks in december is "excessive".

Listen, it is what it is, I'll probably just take 2 weeks off for the holidays instead.

But man is this a reminder that freedom of time is the goal.

I fully acknowledge that I'll probably work more hours when I do my own thing.

However, I also do know that I won't have to ask anyone's permission to take 3 weeks off especially when I have accumulated those days off.
