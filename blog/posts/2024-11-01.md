**Day:** 

- Work went well. I was able to do 2 great demos today. The key was just being myself and not being too nervous.
- Got to have lunch with JB (I love little moments like these).
- Listened to a couple of french songs on youtube (slimane, durel, barbara pravi).
- Went for a walk after work.
- Cooked myself some pasta to carb up.
- Power yoga (take flight series by trevor elliott is helping my left glute a lot).
- Getting ready for the tournament tomorrow.

Short one today as I have a tournament tomorrow.

I don't know how to feel about tournaments anymore.

I used to try and hype myself up, but it simply adds stress.

I want to approach tournaments as a fun event where I just go out there and play my best.

I honestly don't even feel like playing this tournament.

I wasn't able to develop much on the life I want to live today.

I want to introduce more movement in my days, that's for sure.

Less time on the computer also if possible, my neck is killing me.

I'll reflect more on it in the upcoming days for sure.
