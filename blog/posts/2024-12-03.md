**Day:** 

- Productive morning at work.
- Another small karaoke session (already starting to see that practice pays off).
- Watched more episodes of Cross while eating.
- Took a nap.
- MBPC Practice (I was so tired, I'm glad I pushed through though).
- More Cross.
- 2nd instagram post is out (stories / threads / twitter).
- Planning to sleep early ish because I can feel the accumulated fatigue.

I wrote my second post today and it didn't feel as right as the first one.

I do think the more I write, the more anxious I become about not writing well.

It's just something I'm going to have to learn to accept.

Not everything I write will it.

Some of them will, most of them won't.

Hopefully more of them will hit than not, but I can't control that.

The only thing I can focus on is writing from the heart.

If it's from the heart and it's truthful to me, then I'm being honest with myself.

I really want to find a better workflow, but for now, baby steps.

Let me first concentrate on writing consistently and then I'll iterate.

This ain't my first rodeo, I know what to do now.
