**Day:** 

- Work was good, continued working on the web app and making great progress.
- I did a lot of overthinking during the day in regards to AT.
- Went to the gym.
- Got out of my little funk.
- Watched 3 episodes of Shrinking and teared up once in every episode.

I really don't know what's going on with me.

I'm all over the place mentally and, weirdly, it's making me quite productive at work.

I no longer really procrastinate, I just lock in with the work I need to do and when I feel tired, I take a little break and get back into it.

It's been a good comeback at work so far, let's see how long I can keep this up.

I also realized that I encourage everyone to talk to therapist and open up about their problems, but I don't even do that.

I want to keep the image of being someone who has everything figured out when, in fact, I have nothing figured out and actually think I'm a little coucou in the head at the moment.

I should open up more especially to AHS.
