**Day:** 

- Started off my day with a nice 1h walk.
- Visited a new gym that I might sign up for (they have EVERYTHING).
- Work was bad and slow, I did a bit of work, but I was starting to get frustrated with everything (accounts, new trainee, my csm).
- Took the metro to go play badminton (wow, I really miss public transit, it's so nice, need to integrate it more).
- Played only badminton games (I lost ALL of them, tough day at the office).
- JB came to sleep over.
- I had a long long discussion about everything going wrong at the moment (hint: I am my worst enemy, it's all in my mind).

I actually totally forgot about writing my blog post.

Good thing it's not part of my 75HARD challenge.

Yesterday was mentally super exhausting, I was thinking of everything at the same time.

It made me feel hopeless.

I realized two things though:

1. I was still extremely fatigued from my Boston trip and simply needed time to recover.
2. A lot of the troubles with my thoughts come from lack of priority and wanted to ensure myself a better future by doing things now that might pay off later. I don't think this is productive and I simply need to prioritize what I need **right now** and let the future sort itself out.
