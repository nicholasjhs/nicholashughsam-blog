**Day:** 

- Good day at work. Got 2 demos in. The last one was not that good, but we were able to save it, I think.
- Beautiful beautiful day.
- Took a walk in the afternoon.
- Watched some badminton.
- Listened to the "How to take over the world" episode about John Wooden.
- Went to Laue's birthday party and got to talk / reconnect with some HS friends.
- Took another walk at night.

It felt nice to talk with some high school friends.

I even talked to someone that I didn't talk much to during my high school years.

Turns out, she did a masters in social work.

I'd want to take a more entrepreneurial approach to social work.

Freedom of time is still very important for me so I wouldn't want to simply work as a social worker.

It was nice to see that I could have fun in a social setting with people I didn't know that much.

I remember wondering if I had become socially awkward and unable to talk to strangers or do "small talk".

I proved to myself today that I was simply overthinking it.

It also felt nice that I didn't care too much about what they thought about me?

It solidifies my theory that I am getting a better understanding of who I am and who I want to be unapologetically.
