"Do what you love" is a sentence that has been thrown around forever.

Everyone agrees with it, but everyone also has a problem with it.

Why?

Because it tells us nothing about what to do next.

It simply leaves us hanging with the next question which is "well, what do I love?"

It's the equivalent of that one friend that simply tells you to "just be happy" or "don't be sad" when you tell them about your life problems.

Correct, but unhelpful.

Now, there already exists a bunch of questions that attempt to answer this question.

Some of them are focused on the past like "what did you love doing as a child?".

But, honestly, who remembers anything from their childhood? Not me !

Others are focused on the future like "if money were no object, what would you spend your time doing?"

The problem with future focused questions is that humans are so bad at projecting ourselves in imaginary situations that most answers we come up with are generic: "I'd travel the world" or "I'd quit my job and do nothing". Useless.

So, the only category we are left with are present focused questions, which I think are the best.

"What feels like play to you, but work for others?"

"What are you curious about? What do you want to learn more about or try?"

"What activities do you do that make you forget about everything else?"

But even these did not help me much.

I constantly thought that there could be infinite possible answers and some that I might not even be aware of yet (what if pickleball is my secret passion?!)

The only thing that gave me true insights on what I love is taking a reducer approach and stripping everything away.

I told myself: "If I had a magic wand that could automate anything and everything in my life, what wouldn't I use it on?"

"**Would I automate it?**"

Because chances are, if I want to automate it, it's probably because I don't like it.

Writing those formal emails? Automate.

Folding clothes? Automate.

Cooking? Automate.

On the other hand, if I didn't want to automate something, if I was that if it were to be automated, then it's probably because I like it.

Cooking with my girlfriend? Do not automate.

Going to the gym? Do not automate.

Discovering new music? Do not automate.

And what is great about this question is that you can use it in your life, in real time, on any activity that you're doing.

That's precisely how I solved one of the dilemmas I had a few weeks back.

Should I focus on writing or should I focus on making vibe-coded apps?

It didn't take long after starting both and asking myself "would I automate this?" to find my answer.

Writing.

I would never ever want to automate it.

Even back when chatGPT first started and people were going crazy on making it write blog posts, instagram captions, linkedIn articles, etc.

I was uninterested in doing that.

In fact, I absolutely hated and still hate passing my writing through AI (expect for work related things).

I don't get to think about how to make it better, I don't get to struggle through deciphering my thoughts, I don't have the suckiness of starting at a blank page for 15 minutes and I don't get the satisfaction of looking back at my own work and tell myself "wow, it is bomb".

On the other hand, building apps was something I have always wanted to fully automate.

Actually, I had already started delegating most of my projects to AI and I would even catch myself being frustrated that I couldn't automate more !

And this was the big difference.

Whereas I loved the creative process of writing; when it came to building apps, I was solely concentrated on the outcome.

Creating an app, having it go viral, cashing it in.

Absolutely nothing that had to do with the actual work.

So remember, next time you are figuring out what you love, ask yourself "Would I automate it?"

If you would, then you probably don't like it.

If you would not, then it's a good indication that you probably do like it.

P.S. You can also use this as a guide to see what else you can explore next. For example, maybe you'd automate some parts of your job, but not others. Concentrate on those parts you wouldn't automate and try to find more of them at work or in a different role.

BYE !
