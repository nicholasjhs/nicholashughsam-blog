## Bias to Action

If you want to drastically change your life, the one thing you need to think about is bias to action.

What is bias to action? It simply means to take action instead of thinking.

They often say that the best advice is the most simple advice and this is no exception. Nike had it right with their slogan "Just Do It" really is the key to unlocking happiness in your life.

You've already heard this advice plenty of times and you still haven't followed it so let me elaborate a bit further.

If you've read this so far and you felt compelled by the first few sentences, there are excellent chances that you're smart.

How do I know this? Because I'm exactly like you.

Smart recognize smart.

In all other areas of life and in all other context, being smart is a very positive thing, but not right now.

You see, us smart people have a terrible, atrocious, poisoning flaw.

We. think. too. much.

We've been brainwashed by society to optimize every decision we make which means that instead of making a 30 second decision, we take 30 minutes.

When we go to the restaurant, we see something that catches our eye, but do we order that? No, we proceed to scan the whole menu, mentally grab 3-4 choices and then take wayyy too long to finally choose one of them.

When we're about to write any text that matters, do we start writing whatever comes on our mind and then iterate later? No, we write one word, then delete it, then write another word, delete it again and finally stare at the blank paper for 15 minutes before writing our first sentence.

These are only small examples, but there is one big area where this is hurting us the most. It's a very important one that everyone cares about, especially me.

We tend to overthink when it comes to our life choices.

And we are suffering immensely from it.

It's the reason why we are unhappy at this very moment.

How many of us have thought about starting that youtube channel or starting that podcast or starting pottery or opening a coffee shop or starting a business or even making the conscious decision that we want more out of life only to stay in the exact same place over and over again.

Well, after reading this, you'll have no excuse for this type of behaviour because you will be aware of having bias to action.

Bias to action can be broken down into three simple steps:
1. Take action
2. Iterate on that action
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the goal has been completed

Action --> Iteration --> Action --> Iteration --> Action --> Iteration --> [...] --> Goal

Let me give you a concrete example of how to use this.

Let's say your goal is to discover what you're obsessed about aka your passion aka your life's mission.

The standard approach that most people take is to consume a bunch of content, then see something that might interest them and think about whether or not they see themselves doing this forever. But then, as they start thinking about it, they realize that there's something that's hard or that they don't want to do. So then, they start consuming more content and see a shiny new object to think about. They repeat this cycle over and over again inching very slowly towards what they might like, but ultimately going nowhere.

Now, let's take the action-iteration approach.

You see something that interests you and you think might be something you like. You take action and you actually go do that thing. You give yourself a deadline or a number of iterations.

Say, if you think doing a podcast is something you might like, you give yourself the goal to record 8 episodes (btw, that's exactly how Tim Ferriss started his podcast) and the key here is to make it as close as possible to the real deal, but without over thinking it. Remember, you're just testing here.

For a podcast, this involves writing to people and trying to convince them to record an episode with you, it involves doing research prior in order ask them interesting questions, etc.

Try to make it as realistic as possible.

Once the 8 episodes are done, then you can iterate.

Did you like podcasting? How was the experience? Maybe you liked talking to people, but didn't like doing it through zoom calls. The next action is then to do live podcast recordings only. Or if you didn't like podcasting, then it's time to start your search again for the next thing to try.

The difference between the standard approach and this bias to action is that you have definite proof. You actually lived the experience, you actually know. You don't have to spend hours upon hours wondering, instead you know.

And that is the magic in having bias to action.

Now, I know what you might be *thinking*.

"I already know all this, but I can't seem to take action. Whenever I want to take action, there's always something blocking me".

Yes, I know, I've been there. The thing blocking you is called **FEAR**.

You're afraid of making mistakes.

You're afraid that the thing you choose is not it.

You're afraid of having to put more effort if it doesn't pan out.

You're afraid that you might seem like a failure.

You're afraid of other people's opinions about what you want to take action on.

You're afraid that things won't work out.

Some of you are actually afraid of succeeding and getting to the other side of having taken action.

I'm here to tell you that no matter what you do, whether it's taking action or not taking action, there are consequences to both.

The question is what consequences are you willing to suffer through?

If you're debating whether to quit your job or not, you're really debating between "do I want to suffer mentally every day" or "do I want to suffer through the struggles of not having money".

And if you don't know how to answer this question; action-iteration.

Try staying at the job and see how that feels. If it feels bad, then quit.

So that is it, this is essentially the one thing that I **know** will drastically improve all areas of your life.

Believe me, I'm smart.
