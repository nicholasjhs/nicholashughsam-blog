    <h1>Creating my blog (#005)</h1>

	  
<p>
	<strong>Posted: </strong> 8/15/2024<br/>
</p>

<p><strong>Day:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Worked a little bit and managed to get a bit motivated by talking it out with Aaron.</li>
<li>Ate lunch with JB, it's always nice waking up with her !</li>
<li>Went for a long walk, they're the best.</li>
<li>Gym session after feeling tired and sluggish.</li>
<li>Coded my blog with eleventy !</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>It's crazy how long I was putting off creating my blog.</p>
<p>And today I finally decided to do it...</p>
<p>It took me 2 hours to complete, I was so sucked into it.</p>
<p>I guess this is a perfect example of the sayings &quot;the hardest part is always starting&quot; or &quot;starting is already 50% of the job done&quot;.</p>
<p>My blog isn't perfect yet and that's totally fine.</p>
<p>The point of what I'm trying to achieve more of is taking action and iterating.</p>
<p>My blog is the perfect example of that.</p>
<p>It has the minimal style I'm looking for, but it can use a tiny bit more styling.</p>
<p>I also have to make it available to the internet !</p>
<p>Right now though, it's 2:30am, I feel like a night owl / degenerate so Ima stop here.</p>
<p>Feels nice to put in some work and create something out of nothing.</p>
