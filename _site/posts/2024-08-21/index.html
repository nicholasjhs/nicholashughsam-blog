<p><strong>Day:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Not bad at work, honestly. Today, I saw myself staying until my 2 years mark, but I know how quickly things can change.</li>
<li>Started watching The Departed.</li>
<li>Proud to have squeezed in a good gym session (realized that there's still something messed up with my left glute, it was apparent when I did single leg RDLs on the landmine).</li>
<li>Supper with Rob and Nhu.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Man, I came back home at 12 and thought I'd be able to sleep earlier today.</p>
<p>The plan was to get home, take my shower quickly, write my daily entry, brush my teeth, talk to my love and go to sleep.</p>
<p>Instead, I came back home, read 1 chapter of manhwa and then scrolled for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Scrolling is such a waste of time, I really rarely remember whatever I scrolled.</p>
<p>It's like in the movie &quot;Office Space&quot; where Andy asks to be &quot;zapped&quot;.</p>
<p>I just spend time on social media, look at the time and boom, 20-30 minutes have passed.</p>
<p>It really is a huge waste of time.</p>
<p>Luckily, I was still able to finish all I had to do today so I don't feel shitty.</p>
<p>But man, I have to start building the habit of breaking myself off of social media.</p>
