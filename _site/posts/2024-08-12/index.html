    <h1>Reminder of my goals (#001)</h1>

<p><strong>Day:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tired</li>
<li>Not motivated to work</li>
<li>Wonderful having JB over</li>
<li>Off-court workout that was cut short + got ice cream</li>
<li>Came home, JB complemented me on my singing of Confirmation by Biebs</li>
<li>Bought some ice cream for JB</li>
</ul>

<p>After coming back from an amazing camping trip, it felt so bad working my job.</p>
<p>Camping was pure outdoors, bonding with friends, being active, no screen-time, being in nature.</p>
<p>My job is 100% indoors, looking at a screen, talking to my coworkers through a screen, no movement, being on the computer all day.</p>
<p>I haven't figured out how I want to add value to the world yet, which is what will pay me money.</p>
<p>However, I'm massively certain of the lifestyle I want so that I can be happy and my best self.</p>
<p>It's not a very complicated list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Physical activity: I want to be able to workout every single day, be athlete and have a healthy body.</li>
<li>Movement: Without counting the workout, I want to achieve 10k steps just by living; without having to consciously do steps.</li>
<li>Reading: I love reading and have not found a way to integrate it fully into my routine yet. I used to love taking public transit for this reason. Consuming knowledge and learning in an offline, focused manner resonates with me.</li>
<li>Writing: Starting with this very first post, writing is my medium of choice to organize my thoughts and to share them also.</li>
<li>Proper Nutrition: I am so far off right now because I still rely heavily on my mom's cooking. I want to reach a state where I can eat healthy 95% of the time.</li>
<li>Surrounded by like-minded people: This is a big big big one. I love Montreal and I think it really has the potential to be a California or an Austin in terms of health, fitness, lifestyle, self-development. I will become someone who attracts that core community I am looking for, I cannot be the only one in the city who wants a different life.</li>
<li>Aligned work: I tried 4 different corporate jobs and none of them were fulfilling. I even achieved my salary goal 3 years earlier than I thought and that didn't change much. In order for me to be my best self, I know that I need to work with people. In what capacity, I am not sure yet. I believe there are a lot of unhappy people that do not need to be (myself included) and I'd love to play a part in helping those people. Teacher? Coach? Influencer?</li>
</ol>
<p>Every day, I need to remember that the above is my goal.</p>
<p>Everything else is noise from external pressures.</p>
<p>Luckily, I realized as I typed this out that I can start a few of my ultimate goals TODAY.</p>
<p>Let's get the party started.</p>
