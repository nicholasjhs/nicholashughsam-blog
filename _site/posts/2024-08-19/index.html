<p><strong>Day:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Worked at JB's place.</li>
<li>Had a surprising conversation with her middle sister.</li>
<li>Got a decent amount of work done. I think if I concentrate on completing 3 tasks per day, put on some music, I can make it work temporarily.</li>
<li>Ate lunch with JB.</li>
<li>Played overcook with JB.</li>
<li>Died at the off-court MBPC practice ( felt really good to push myself, but did not feel good to feel like fainting haha)</li>
<li>Late night call and physically dying with JB.</li>

<p>Overthinking is a coping mechanism we use to not do the action.</p>
<p>While thinking about my workshop, I was thinking of all the different reasons why we do not take action.</p>
<p>One of them is that we spend more time thinking about the problem than taking action.</p>
<p>So I asked myself &quot;Why do we / I overthink?&quot;</p>
<p>And the conclusion I've reached is that overthinking is less scary and less effort than actually doing the thing and finding out.</p>
<p>It's a pervasive idea that has been reinforced by society. This idea of being smart, being intellectual, thinking through your problems.</p>
<p>The more I advance in my inner work journey, the more I realize that solution to all problems is simply to take more action and try things out.</p>
<p>I remember about 8 years ago or so, I came up with this theory to &quot;live life like a scientist&quot; where the perfect way of living was to pose some hypotheses and try to prove or disprove them.</p>
<p>I think this is even more relevant now than it was 8 years ago.</p>
<p>With social media, internet and everything, it becomes so much easier to pretend you're doing something.</p>
<p>Whether it be by watching Tik Tok videos, consuming podcasts, watching youtube, scrolling X or your IG feed.</p>
<p>The only real way of knowing something, anything is to try it out.</p>
<p>And overthinking is just another excuse we have to not take action.</p>
<p>I'm here spending hours in my head, thinking about every little detail, trying to make the perfect workshop (because of fear as I mentioned before) and, yet, you know what would probably be better than this?</p>
<p>Showing up with the bare minimum plan aka the material for the workshop and doing it.</p>
<p>Then, when it's over, simply ask for feedback from everyone who attended on what to keep and what to improve on.</p>
<p>Then, implement whatever feedback was given and whatever I think could be improved.</p>
<p>This action based approach could probably delivery an amazing workshop after 4 sessions, but that's too much right?</p>
<p>We want it to be perfect the first try ! So we think and think and think to the point that it's officially overthinking.</p>
<p>You never overthink things that do not scare you.</p>
<p>Let me repeat that: You never overthink things that do not scare you.</p>
<p>Have you ever overthought doing the dishes?</p>
<p>What about cleaning your place? Do you spend hours about the perfect way to clean your place?</p>
<p>Or to shower? Or to brush your teeth?</p>
<p>Hell no ! (hopefully, if not, my condolences)</p>
<p>We simply do it and improve on it over time.</p>
<p>This sounds oversimplified, but I'm truly understanding that it's the secret to life.</p>
<p>Let's not overcomplicate things, just start with the simple version, take action instead of overthinking the complicated version.</p>
<p>Voila.</p>
