    <h1>Bias to action and workshop (#002)</h1>

</p>

<p><strong>Day:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tired again.</li>
<li>Felt a bit more motivated to work and got a bit of it done, but I'm still in a work rut.</li>
<li>Went for a marvellous walk during lunchtime where I thought more about becoming an influencer and what would that entail.</li>
<li>Over thought a little bit about what should I do with my life, what do I think is play aka effortless, etc.</li>
<li>Rage room with Mr. PDS (it was alright, would not recommend because the environment is too controlled 5/10).</li>
<li>MBPC Practice (good practice, need to improve on my backcourt forehand cross and backcourt overhead straight smash).</li>
<li>Listened to Diary of a CEO with Codie Sanchez (big concepts to remember is bias to action and what are you obsessed about)</li>
<li>Treated myself to some poulet rougeeee.</li>
<li>Wrote an article / blog about having bias to action.</li>
<li>Slept later than I wished (currently 12:30)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>While listening to the Diary of a CEO episode with Codie Sanchez, I realized that the most important thing when consuming content is simply remembering and actioning 1-2 concepts. That is all.</p>
<p>It's impossible to recall every single piece of advice; however, if there's 1 that sticks with you, that is the aim.</p>
<p>I also thought of making doing some sort of newsletter series about this. Where I listen to podcasts or videos and write an essay about 1 big important concept that struck my chord.</p>
<p>The other thing that caught my brain during the podcast is this concept of obsession. Find what you are obsessed about.</p>
<p>I noticed that every time I consume anything, the one thing I always look for is advice / tips on how to live a better life. It's truly one thing I am absolutely obsessed about.</p>
<p>Finally, I wrote a whole ass article about having bias to action and it gave me an excellent idea for my workshop / seminar.</p>
<p>What about a workshop on applying the action-iteration approach on how to find your passion / obsession / what you want to do with your life (gosh that's such a long sentence).</p>
<p>It'll have all the elements, story-telling, theory behind why I think action-iteration approach is a cheat code of life (especially for smart / overthinking people) and, at the end, the workshop element is to create an IRL Call-To-Action by having people write down 1 thing they're supposed to action on.</p>
<p>I thought about maybe putting every one in a group chat or fb group where they each post what they should do and see if they follow through.</p>
<p>The last idea I had was possibly making this recurring on a weekly basis, we meet once a week, for 2 hours, and we discuss about if we took action or not, if someone didn't I can dive deeper into WHY they didn't take action and people can learn from it.</p>
