<p><strong>Day:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent MBPC practice (starting to hit my shots higher)</li>
<li>JB cooked some good lunch for me (pork brochette + zucchini invention + rice)</li>
<li>Worked a little bit on my workshop (writing the copy for it is harder than I thought, need to remember to take action and iterate instead of wanting perfect from the get-go)</li>
<li>Ate supper at my mom's (good discussion about family)</li>
<li>JB practiced driving</li>
<li>I'm sleeping over and getting ready for the next day</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Holyfuuuuuuck am I tired with my thoughts.</p>
<p>I tried writing the description of my workshop today and only managed to write about 300 words.</p>
<p>I had this epic idea of writing a landing page / sales letter text in the description and instead of making this a reality, I simply stared way too long at my screen.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Because I was scared, that's why !</p>
<p>Actually, scratch that, I am still scared.</p>
<p>I am scared that I'll publish the event and absolutely no one will attend it. (except for Danny)</p>
<p>That caused me to get writer's block.</p>
<p>In order to make sure that people come, I put the pressure on myself to write the perfect freaking description and because I obviously am not the Mozart of writing event descriptions, I couldn't write shit !</p>
<p>Every time I thought about something, my head would immediately block it off and say &quot;no, that's not good enough ! People won't come with just this&quot;.</p>
<p>And that is totally the wrong approach and against how I want to live and what I want to teach.</p>
<p>The event should be an expression of being my authentic self and my authentic self is having fun while teacher others about the joys and benefits of living a life more aligned with our true selves.</p>
<p>I am confident if I just manage to think, meditate, visualize the state I am in when I operate from my true self, I will write beautifully.</p>
<p>It won't be a sales-y, pitch-y text. Instead, it'll be more like art.</p>
<p>Something that can be felt with their soul, not with their head.</p>
<p>I am grateful today happened. It's a good reminder of how I want to live and a good reminder to take action and iterate instead of overthinking and trying to make things perfect.</p>
<p>I am confident in my path, I just need to be consistent enough to see it through.</p>
