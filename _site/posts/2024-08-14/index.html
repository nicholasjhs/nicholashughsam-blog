    <h1>Quit, it's the right thing to do (#003)</h1>

<p><strong>Day:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Boring day at work, sales engineer might not be for me because I am unable to be authentic and tell the truth.</li>
<li>Discovered 2 fire songs: For Cryin' Out Loud! by FINNEAS and Dream by Keshi.</li>
<li>Went for a walk which made my sore back/hips feel 10000x better; good reminder that walking is <strong>essential</strong>.</li>
<li>Officially became an uncle !! Congratulations again to my broski and sistah (in law).</li>
<li>Little impromptu date with JB, we went to Clip n Climb, it was very fun. Scary, but fun.</li>
<li>Discovered SHOP SANTE and loved it.</li>
<li>Cooked salmon, string beans and pasta with rose sauce.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>I seriously thought about quitting work today.</p>
<p>I actually know the truth, the truth is that I do want to quit.</p>
<p>The second truth is that I'm also scared about not having money to pay off my mortgage and having to downgrade my lifestyle significantly.</p>
<p>The third truth is that I ultimately know I have to quit for my own well being, values and the person I want to be.</p>
<p>It does not make sense to stay at a job which makes me unhappy, unfulfilled and makes me feel like I'm an underachiever for not putting my all into his work.</p>
<p>There is nothing I would love more than to give my all to work I am passionate about.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this ain't it chief.</p>
<p>The only belief I need is the belief that everything will be alright. If I quit, I will figure out a way to cover my expenses.</p>
<p>It does not serve me to ponder and ponder and ponder about what I'm going to do and, frankly, I now know myself well enough to know that no matter what backup plan I come up with, I will throw it out of the window less than 3 months in.</p>
<p>I just need to muster up the courage to do it.</p>
<p>It's crazy that my #1 concern is financial (expected), but my #2 concern is what people at my company will think.</p>
<p>I am literally letting people's opinions of me, stop me from helping myself and even helping them. The fact they have me as an employee is a disservice to them. Instead of me, they can have someone who is passionate about my role and who would put it 5x more work than me.</p>
<p>Negative energy is present in the world when people do things they are unhappy about.</p>
<p>Me at my current job is an example.</p>
<p>The more I stay, the more negative energy I create for myself, the company and the world.</p>
<p>It's time to take a leap of faith before I turn 30 and try to create positivity.</p>
