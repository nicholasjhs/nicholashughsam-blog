    <h1>About</h1>

	  <p>In 2018, I graduated from a top university in a top program with some top grades.</p>
<p>It's only normal that I thought what was going to come next was: the top of my life.</p>
<p>A fulfilling career, great relationships, lots of money, happiness all around and feeling at the top of the world.</p>
<p>Except, that's not what happened at all.</p>
<p>You see, I actually got a bachelor's in Software Engineer.</p>
<p>Did I love software engineer? Nope.</p>
<p>Did I love coding? Nope.</p>
<p>In fact, the only thing I knew about software engineer before applying was that it had something to do with computers...</p>
<p>but did that stop me from applying? Nope.</p>
<p>The word around town was that employment was almost a guarantee and everyone in the field was making big bucks. And that was enough for me it seems.</p>
<p>Fast forward almost 7 years where I tried 3 different roles (Software Engineer, Business Technology Analyst and Solutions Engineer) across 4 different companies and I was still feeling totally unfufilled and uninspired in my career.</p>
<p>Not only that, but during the past 7 years, I also consumed dozens of self-help &amp; business books, hundreds of hours listening to various podcasts and thousands of hours watching YouTube videos from anyone and everyone.</p>
<p>And what did that amount to? Nothing, except a lot of overthinking, some mild episodes of depression and some more doing nothing.</p>
<p>Well, all that changed when, in the summer of 2024, I decided to take a leap of faith and sign up for some coaching sessions with one of the best podcasters in the world (at the time).</p>
<p>Even though I was very skeptical at first, it actually transformed my life because those coaching sessions forced me to do one thing: take authentic action.</p>
<p>The coaching forced me to look real hard at myself and at all the programming I've received since I was young and filter out everything that was noise vs everything that was me.</p>
<p>Thus, I was able to take action that was aligned with who I truly am. And it was liberating.</p>
<p>I've now come to realize that I want to spend my time studying, helping and teaching about how to live happier, freer and more authentic lives.</p>
<p>And although I am still (and always will be) a work in progress, I am eager to share what I learned.</p>
<p>Here are a few sentences that I connect with:</p>
<ul>
<li>The truth shall set you free.</li>
<li>All is well right now.</li>
<li>It is simple, we just overcomplicate it.</li>
<li>You are your own hero.</li>
<li>Life is about progress, not perfection.</li>
<li>Don't think. Take action and iterate.</li>
</ul>
